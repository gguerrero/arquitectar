# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

          In its commitment to the revitalization of the city, 
          <b style="color: #532A01;">arquitectar</b> boosts renovation of residential, 
          community spaces, facilities, shops...
          </p>
          <p>
          For this, we facilitate the management of aids for the <strong>rehabilitation 
          of buildings</strong> on <strong>neighboorhods</strong>. We propose an 
          accurate diagnosis as the basis for an Improvement Plan, prioritized on 
          the basis of need and the economic capacity of the moment. To do this, 
          we start from the <strong>Technical Building Inspection</strong>, which 
          discusses: foundations and structure / facades / thermal / supply and 
          drainage, but in order to comfort, we encourage ITE + (+ accessibility + 
          habitable + ventilation and natural lighting, + thermal comfort / energy 
          saving efficiency of plants, + acoustic comfort).
          </p>
          <p>
          We promote urban commerce also writing activity projects, eliminating 
          architectural barriers, performing image enhancements (lighting projects, 
          new distributions reusing existing furniture), local reforms, sustainable 
          interior and optimizing resources through energy audits. The latter allows 
          to multiply the efficiency of the facilities (schools, offices, sports 
          facilities, markets ...) too.
          </p>
          <p>
          Similarly, <b style="color: #532A01;">arquitectar</b> promotes 
          <strong>building renovation</strong> by individuals in rural areas, 
          since in many cases it can extend the life of the building through a 
          change in use. In view of the pre-existing, value is placed on the 
          property. All this without sacrificing modern conveniences and, as 
          required, it is possible to achieve a reduction in consumption of 
          energy, water and waste.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b style="color: #532A01;">arquitectar</b> also provides 
          <strong>technical advice on sustainability</strong>: thermography and 
          diagnostics, design strategies, energy efficiency or building 
          certification and training and outreach.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our range centered at <strong>Vitoria</strong>, reaches: 
          <strong>Bilbao-Bizkaia, Donostia-Gipuzkoa, Logroño, La Rioja, 
          Pamplona-Navarra, ​​Burgos</strong> and even <strong>Zaragoza</strong>.

          <h4>Comforting</h4>
          <p>More than rehabilitate, we focus on the renewal, linking with tradition 
          by extending the useful life of the building and reuse items available while 
          updating the home with the services and amenities of today's standards.</p>
          <h4>Criteria</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Design according to the orientation of each facade</li>
            <li>Reuse, repair, replace: Waste 0</li>
            <li>Reduce water and energy consumption</li>
            <li>Solutions reversible</li>
            <li>Healthy materials: long life and low maintenance</li>
